## Overview
Build an e-commerce shopping cart application using **Next.js** or **SvelteKit**. The application will feature a product listing page showcasing various products with details and an "Add to Cart" functionality. Additionally, a dedicated cart page will allow users to manage items, including quantity adjustments, removal, and total price calculations with potential discounts.

## Technical Specifications

- **Frontend Framework**: ReactJS or Svelte
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Plain CSS

## Data Source

**Option 1**: Create a local JSON file containing product data (e.g., product name, image, price, description, etc.).

**Option 2**: Utilize an open-source API to fetch product data dynamically.

## Detailed Features

### Product Listing Page
- Display at least 6-10 products using a grid layout.
- Each product card should include:
  - Product image
  - Product name
  - Product price (formatted for currency)
  - "Add to Cart" button

### Add to Cart Functionality
- Clicking the "Add to Cart" button on a product should:
  - Add the chosen product to the user's virtual shopping cart.
  - Update the cart icon or a dedicated counter to reflect the number of added items (optional).
  - Provide visual feedback (e.g., animation) confirming the item's addition.

### Cart Page
- Display a dedicated cart page where users can manage their selected products.
- The cart page should include:
  - A list of all added products, displaying:
    - Product image
    - Product name
    - Product price
    - Quantity selector (up/down buttons or input field) to adjust the amount of each item.
    - "Remove Item" button to delete a specific product from the cart.
  - **Cart summary section**:
    - **Subtotal**: Calculate the total cost of all items in the cart based on their quantity and price.
    - **Discounts (optional)**: Implement the ability to apply discounts on the total price. This could involve:
      - Fixed discounts (e.g., "$10 off")
      - Percentage discounts (e.g., "10% off")
    - **Total price (including discounts)**: Display the final price the user needs to pay.
    - **Checkout button (optional)**: This can redirect to a simulated checkout page or provide a message indicating successful cart addition.
